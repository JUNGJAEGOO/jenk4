</table><p>###<br/>Scene management</p><p>A lot of developers use multiple scenes when creating a game with unity. For example, they develop a game by separating menu scene, game scene and end scene. When a player enters the game room, NetworkManager automatically loads scenes set in Online Scene. On the other hand, if service use has ended as the player ends the game and leaves the room, it will load Offline Scene.</p><p>But if a scene used before connecting to the network and an online scene are same, do not perform a scene loading. Same goes for an offline scene, do not perform a scene loading for same scenes. In other words, multiplayer contents can be added to a game composed of a single scene. Then from the moment entering the game room till the end, other scene can be loaded for use additionally.</p><h3>Match making</h3><p>TOAST Cloud’s real time multiplayer service provides the very basic way of match making service. Match making conducts matching according to the string set in RoomType.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Level matching</strong> For matchings based on scores, divide player’s score in certain intervals and create a string based on that value. For example, if a player with score of 111, designate game_1 type matching with the value dividing 100 in order to designate a matching between players in the score range of 100.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Game type matching</strong> Like MORPG, if a player selects to enter a certain dungeon, it can be designated to perform matching by designating the applicable dungeon name.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Game version related matching</strong> If a client version needs to be classified, designate to perform matching by adding client version information.</p></li>
</ul><h3>Listener settings</h3><p>NetworkManager has a function to notify status information in three categories. They are Connected status connected to TOAST Cloud, JoinedGame status joined in the game room after a verification process and lastly, Disconnected status disconnected the connection. If a required action is needed depending on the status change, make a script as follows and drag to NetworkManager inspector’s Listener item.</p>
<pre><code>public class Listener : MonoBehaviour {

    ///

    /// Connected to TOAST Cloud
    ///

    void OnConnect() {}

    ///

    /// Failed to connect TOAST Cloud
    ///

    void OnFailedToConnect() {}

    ///

    /// Joined a Game
    ///

    void OnJoinedGame() {}

    ///

    /// Disconnected from TOAST Cloud
    ///

    void OnDisconnected() {}
}
</code></pre><h3>Create game objects</h3><p>Creating game objects dynamically in a multiplayer game is one of necessary functions. Game objects can be created dynamically by registering Prefab to be created in NetworkManager before connecting to the network. To register in NetworkManager, the applicable game object must include NetworkIdentity component.</p><p><img src="http://static.toastoven.net/prod_realtimemultiplayer/img_28.jpg" /></p><p>Registered prefab can be created dynamically by calling API provided by RealtimeNetwork as follows.</p>
<pre><code>RealtimeNetwork.Instantiate (playerPrefab, position, rotation);
</code></pre><h3>Multiplexing</h3><p>Multiplexing is a way to present unnecessary data delay by having a domain to delete dependence between other data. For example, if A data and B data are designated as Reliable Sequenced QoS but do not depend on each other, it is better for the loss of A data avoid the delay of B data. In order to prevent these unnecessary delays, it is best to assign each domain with no dependency to separate channels.</p><p>NetworkManager Channel Count designates the max number of channels for use. A range possible to assign is minimum of 5 to maximum of 50, and because 0 and the first channels are used for internal data, it is better not to use them.</p><h3>Network setting</h3><p>If Advanced Configuration is activated in the inspector, network engine’s default option can be changed. However, it is not recommended to set this function except for special occasions.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>MTU Size</strong> MTU size changes are used to prevent fragmentation of IP class by reducing the value in a serviced country or region where network infra condition is not good. Fragmentation of IP class may raise the network delay even more.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Ping Interval</strong> If there is no need to recognize client’s connection status sensitively, expand Ping send interval, if need to recognize sensitively, it can be reduced to minimum of 500 milliseconds.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Disconnection Timeout</strong> Indicates the max time value to wait until receiving the response message for reliability data after sending it. Minimum value is 1000 milliseconds and max is 5000 milliseconds.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>CRC Enable</strong> Activate data’s integrity check function. Considering the national network environment, it is not recommended to activate this.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Max Unreliable Commands</strong> This function is useful if rendering loop has stopped due to Cellular-Wi-Fi hand over or user manipulation, and this function deletes previous data piled up in the queue and reflects latest data.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Waning Queue Size</strong> If there is more data piled up in network engine internal queue than the designated threshold value, a Warning message is generated.</p></li>
</ul><h3>API</h3><p>[Properties]</p>

</table><h2>RealtimeNetwork</h2><p>Once the network is activated, RealtimeNetwork provides high level of API that can produce real time multiplayer contents. Because RealtimeNetwork provides static functions and static properties only that it does not need to create separate objects. Major functions that RealtimeNetwork provides are as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Create and destroy game objects</p></li>
  <li><p>RPC</p></li>
  <li><p>Synch server time</p></li>
</ul><h3>Creation and destruction of game objects</h3><p>Formation and destruction of game objects on network is a required function in a multiplayer game. By using Instantiate function that RealtimeNetwork provides, a game object can be created in the game room. A few constraint conditions related to formation are as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Game objects that can be created on the network dynamically are limited to the ones that are designated in Registered Spawnable Prefab of NetworkManager, and the registered game objects must include NetworkIdentity component.</p></li>
  <li><p>Only a player with a master authority can created prefab set by a master ownership.</p></li>
  <li><p>A player who created prefab set by a local player’s ownership gets the primary ownership.</p></li>
</ul><p>If a game object needs to be destroyed, use a Destroy function that RealtimeNetwork provides. Only the player who has an ownership of a game object to be deleted can delete the game object using the Destroy. As the second factor of Destroy function can set the delete delay time, functions like Destroy of GameObject can be easily realized on the network.</p><h3>RPC</h3><p>RPC of RealtimeNetwork provides functions to send and receive messages between players.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Ephemeral message, Persistent message</p></li>
  <li><p>Unicast</p></li>
  <li><p>Multicast</p></li>
</ul><p>Requirements for script and game object to be called to RPC are as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Class to be used in RPC need to inherit NetworkBehaviour.</p></li>
  <li><p>Game object which includes script to be used must include NetworkIdentity component.</p></li>
</ul><p>RPC provides two types of message. First, Ephemeral which sends a message to players connected to the current game room and Persistent method which saves a message in the game room are provided. Similar to message send and receive of general network communications, Ephemeral type sends temporarily limited to players currently in the game room. However, Persistent type is saved in the game room classified as an assigned script and function. As an example of a use, if a player with a master ownership assigns a certain RPC as Persistent and sends to a game room, players currently connected will receive the message right away and players who connected after this will receive same RPC message. Assigned Persistent message can be deleted from the game room using the RemoveRPC function.</p><p>RealtimeNetwork’s RPC supports unicast and multicast. In other words, it not only sends a message to a particular player but also to all the players in the game room or to a particular player group.</p><h3>Time synch</h3><p>Despite the fact the time synch is a necessary element in games like a great war, it is not easy to share same time value due to a network environment and physical distance. Moreover, if each player is in a different time zone, a local time cannot be used so the server time should be used as a reference time. FetchServerTimestamp function of RealtimeNetwork and ServerTime property allows an easy synch of time between players. Especially in a mobile environment, it supports time synch considering the network performance gap occurred between Cellular and Wi-Fi.</p><p>FetchServerTimestamp is a desynch function which, once synch is completed, ServerTime returns values bigger than 0. In case of an initial call, client performs the time synch function by calling FetchServerTimestamp internally, but considering the mobile environment, one more call is recommended before starting the game.</p><h3>API</h3><p>[Properties]</p><p>RealtimeNetwork provides static functions and static properties. Functions and properties of RealtimeNetwork are as follows.</p>

</table><h3>Send speed</h3><p>Setting transmission rate for game object synch is very important for natural display of performance and game. Because NetworkTransform supports Interpolation, transmission rate can be designated following the characteristics of a game, and designate transmission rate appropriate for the role of each game object.</p><p>It may seem it is best to send data for every frame to reduce the delay between the send device and receive device, but actually if data is sent for every frame, it has a negative effect on the game performance. Therefore, since the delay of position information sent to the network is unavoidable, interpolation must be used necessarily, and it is recommended to reduce a delay by restricting the character’s moving speed and to use interpolation. Except for special occasions, 10 times per second on PC and 6 times per second on a mobile device are recommended.</p><h3>Synch mode</h3><p>Synch technique varies depending on the game property and the purpose of use of game object. NetworkTransform component supports easy game object synch by providing synch technique as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>SyncTransform</strong> : Perform sync without using the interpolation. Immediately reflect recent data received through network in the game object.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>SyncRigidbody2D</strong> : Sync by changing the velocity value of Rigidbody2D using the interpolation. Rigidbody2D component must be included.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>SyncRigidbody3D</strong> : Sync the velocity value of Rigidbody using the interpolation. Rigidbody component must be included.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>SyncCharacterControl</strong> : Sync CharacterController component coordinates using the interpolation. CharacterController component must be included.</p></li>
</ul><h3>Channel settings</h3><p>To use data multiplexing, designate dedicated channels in NetworkTransform. If there is not a lot of data, it may be a way to send all data via channel 3 which is assigned as a default rather than assigning a particular channel, but if there is a lot of data, using multiple channels to avoid interference between data is more efficient. By using NetworkManager inspector’s Channel Count item or ChannelCount API, designate the max channel number, and assign a unique channel to each NetworkTransform within the range of designated channels. For example, if Channel Count is designated as 10, channels from 0 to 10 can be used. But since channel 0 and 1 are used internally and channel 3 is a default channel, it is recommended to avoid them and it is best to use channels from 4 to 10 for dedicated channels. Since unnecessary channel formation is not good for the performance, it is better to designate a reasonable number of channels.</p><h3>API</h3><p>Provides property corresponding to the functions provided by inspector.</p><p>[Properties]</p>

</table><h2>NetworkBehaviour</h2><p>NetworkBehaviour is a class a script must inherit in order to use the functions Real Time Multiplayer provides in the user defined script. Because NetworkBehaviour inherited UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour, MonoBehaviour function can be used. A game object which includes a user defined class that has inherited NetworkBehaviour with NetworkTransform as a component must include one NetworkIdentity component.</p><h3>Start and end of the game</h3><p>Upon entering the game room, overriding OnStart function will be called. In reverse, upon leaving the game room or network disconnection, OnLeave function will be called.</p><h3>Confirm player’s access</h3><p>When a player joins or leave the game room currently involved in, receive an applicable event message by overriding OnJoinedRoom and OnLeavedRoom. If a player designated as a master left the game room, receive a number of a player who is newly designated as a master through OnLeavedRoom message.</p><h3>User defined sync</h3><p>Synch data that requires continuous reflection through overriding in user defined script with virtual functions of NetworkBehaviour, OnSerialize and OnDeserialize. For example, if the size of a game object that is not supported by NetworkTransform continuously requires synch, it can be developed by adding the applicable logic in OnSerialize and OnDeserialize. It is a realization of NetworkTransform position and rotation synch using the applicable function. However, it is recommended to use RPC for data that does not require continuous synch.</p><p>After the initial call of OnSerialize function, designate DirtyBit as true if synch is required as it is called only when DirtyBit property value is true. Once data is sent, DirtyBit will automatically change to false. If you want to reflect latest data with OnSerialize function when a new player joins the game room, designate DirtyBit as true. For details on applicable functions, refer to NetworkTransform source code provided.</p><p>NetworkBehaviour can designate send interval, channels and QoS through function overriding. Send interval is set to designate in seconds. For example, if the user wants to send data every 200 milliseconds, set it as 0.2. It is different from the inspector as the inspector designates number of times in seconds. Channels can be changed by overriding GetNetworkChannel functions and must be designated within the designated maximum channels in NetworkManager Channel Count. QoS basic value is designated as UnreliableSequenced, and for data that requires continuous reflection, UnreliableSequenced QoS is recommended as the basic value is.</p><h3>API</h3><p>NetworkBehaviour API is composed of a virtual function to receive properties related to the current game object ownership and certain events, a virtual function to send and receive user data and a property.</p><p>[Properties]</p>
